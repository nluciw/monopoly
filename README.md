Monopoly analysis project

The purpose of this project is to analyze the best way to play the 
game monopoly, by visualizing characteristics such as the distribution
of the locations of pieces after each turn. Features such as jail, 
cards, and special squares are the first to be implemented. Money, 
property ownership, rent, and houses will be later additions.
